# Networking Toolkit

## About the Project

[CLI-Networking-Script](https://github.com/haant/Networking-Toolkit/blob/main/CLI_networking_script.png)

This script contains several classes that perform various network-related tasks. The SpeedTest class uses the speedtest module to measure the download and upload speed of the user's internet connection in megabits per second (Mbps). The PingIP class allows the user to ping a specific IP address and returns the ping results. The PortScanner class allows the user to scan the ports of a specific IP address, either the current IP or an inputted IP. Additionally, the user can also scan a specific port with an inputted IP address. The script is written in Python and is designed to be easy to use and understand, making it a useful tool for network administrators, developers and anyone who works with networks.
